<h2>Project Oasis</h2>
<p>In the distant future, you play as an aspiring hoverboarder (known as Star Skaters) who travels to a neighboring planet where a contest (Project Oasis) is being held by a giant corporation (The Identity) for select star skaters. This planet is billed as a dream oasis for star skaters, where the very architecture kept skaters in mind, and there are parks and contests littered throughout the island. The premise is simple, the top skaters move on to the next round of competitions, until the final skaters are declared pros and given large prizes. But, there is something amiss on the island after landing. You immediately notice that outside of the immediate contests, living conditions seem like the whole island is a facade, and it is up to you to figure out what is really going on and change the course of the entire planet in the process.</p>
